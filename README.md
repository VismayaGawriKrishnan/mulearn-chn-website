# μLearn CHN – Website Redesign

A complete redesign of the **μLearn CHN (Cochin Hub Network)** website with a modern **purplish–blue neon-inspired theme**, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The goal is simple: **clean structure, strong visual identity, and smooth interactions** — not overengineered nonsense.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Redesign the existing μLearn CHN website with a **modern, tech-focused UI**
- Improve **visual hierarchy, readability, and engagement**
- Keep the stack **simple and maintainable** (no frameworks for the sake of it)
- Make the site **responsive, fast, and scalable**

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

This redesign follows three non-negotiable principles:

1. **Structure over decoration**  
   Visuals support content — they don’t replace it.

2. **Consistency in color & spacing**  
   Purplish-blue gradients are used intentionally, not randomly.

3. **Performance first**  
   Lightweight assets, optimized animations, zero bloat.

## 🎨 Color Theme

Primary palette is inspired by **neon purples, pinks and blues**, commonly associated with tech communities and futuristic design.

| Usage            | Color |
|------------------|-------|
| Primary Accent   | `#7F5AF0` |
| Secondary Accent | `#4D96FF` |
| Background Dark  | `#0F0F1A` |
| Text Light       | `#EDEDED` |
| Highlight Glow   | `#A78BFA` |

Gradients are used sparingly to avoid visual fatigue.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Semantic, accessible markup
- **CSS3** – Custom styling, gradients, animations, Flexbox & Grid
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Interactions, animations, DOM logic

No frameworks. No dependencies. No excuses.
